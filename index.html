				<h2>Abstract</h2>

		<p>I am guilty of idolatry. I’ve violated the sacred Second Commandment. <span class="italic">“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD you God am a jealous God...”.</span> Yet I am not alone in this, many Christians have not been shy to depict the holy trinity since the coming of Christ.<br><br>
		Whilst the second commandment has been taken very lightly in many cases it is not fully absent, it is still respected in various ways within the religious field. However, many contemporary depictions of the <span class="italic">‘divine’</span> have outgrown their restricted boundaries entirely and pledged themselves fully to the sin of idolatry.<br><br>
		Outgrown and evolved. Many young eyes have fixed their gaze on high definition digital screens, the more contemporary beacons of faith. Portals to the <span class="italic">‘likeness of anything that is in heaven above...’</span>, worlds beyond our own, not just to look at, but to immerse oneself in. Video games and their <span class="italic">‘magical claiming’</span> power have created their own forms of contemporary religion accompanied with new rituals and sacred vows. Idolatry worship that will pave a lit path that helps guide the young and lost in our own real, complex and chaotic existence.

				<h2>Gods and Demons</h2>

		<p><span class="subtitle">Religion Summary from <a>‘The Horrors and Absurdities of Religion’</a>, by Arthur Schopenhauer</span><br><br>

		I am very aware of the fact that writing about the vast subject of religion is a very daunting and challenging thing. I myself must admit that I do not have nor will I ever have similar amounts of knowledge about the subject as any theologist out there. That does however not take away the fact that I share similar interests of study. I will share my gathered knowledge with the best interest without trying to subjectively touch upon the core values of religion. I acknowledge that this is easier said than done, so you might want to see this small paragraph as some sort of a disclaimer if you will.<br><br>

		So without further ado I would like to start sharing some insight into the evolution and origin of religious idolatry or image making. I would like to start by sharing a very well formulated description about the purpose of Christian religion written by Arthur Schopenhauer before we get to the visual aspects of religion. The description can be found inside the first chapter of the book ‘The Horrors and Absurdities of Religion’. The first chapter is called <a>‘On Religion : A Dialogue’</a>. The chapter consist of a dialogue or discussion between two fictional philosophers personified by Schopenhauer himself. In the discussion religion is seen as a substitute for raw philosophy. Philosophy would be the non religious teachings of necessary morals and other values, yet these teachings might not be available for everyone. Therefore religion serves as its substitute, a more accessible means of teaching the much needed morals and values, not raw, but wrapped in allegory, myth and symbolism, that which leads to idolatry.</p>

<abbr title="Gustave Dore, 1883"><img src="images/dore.jpg"></abbr>

<div class="text">
		<span class="italic">“Philalethes Oh yes, more or less as a wooden leg takes the place of a natural one: it substitutes for it, does duty for it as best it can, claims to be regarded as a natural leg, is artificially put together well or less well, and so on. The only difference is that, while a natural leg as a rule preceded the wooden one, religion has everywhere got the start on Philosophy. <br><br>

		Demopheles That may be: But if you haven’t got a natural leg a wooden one is very useful. You must bear in mind that the metaphysical need of man absolutely demands satisfaction, because the horizon of his thoughts must be closed and not remain unbounded. But man has as a rule no capacity for weighing reasons and then deciding between true and false; moreover, the labor which nature and its needs impose upon him leaves him no time for such inquiries, nor for the education they presuppose. In his case, therefore, there can be no question of conviction by reasons: he must be referred to belief and authority. Evin if a really true and philosophy had taken the place of religion, nine-tenths of mankind at the very least would receive it on authority, so that it too would be a matter of belief. Authority, however, can be established only by time and circumstance: it cannot be bestowed upon that which has only reasons in its favor. It must be allowed to that which has acquired it during the course of history, even if it is only allegorical representation of truth. This representation, supported by authority, appeals first of all to the actual metaphysical predisposition of man, to the theoretical need which arises from the importunate enigma of our existence and from the consciousness that behind the world’s physical plane there must be concealed a metaphysical, something unchanging which serves as a basis for the world’s continual change; then, however, it appeals to the will, to the fears and hopes of mortals living in constant distress, for whom it accordingly creates god and demons on whom the can call, whom they can appease, whom they can win over; finally, it appeals to the moral consciousness undeniably present in man, to which it lends external stay and confirmation, a support without which it would not easily be able to maintain itself  in the struggle with so many temptations. It is precisely from this side that religion affords an inexhaustible source of consolation and comfort in the countless and great sufferings of life which does not desert men even in the hour of death but rather only then reveals its full efficacy. Religion must thus be compared to one who takes a blind man by the hand and leads him, since he cannot see for himself and the sole point is that he should arrive at his destination, not that he should see all there is to see.”</span><br><br>

		<p>This text was written in the nineteenth century. Yet the majority of the modern world, more than three fourth, is still religious whilst having access to philosophy in almost all cases. There is an everlasting and unquestionable urge in mankind to create Gods and Demons alike. Such are the idols that we worship. However, the creation of idols those not go unquestioned and interferes with the core values of religion. We will take a brief look at the preferred method of communication of Christian religion and why this leads to image making or idolatry.</p> <br><br>

				<h3 id="III">III</h3>
				<h2>The Second Commandment</h2>

		<p><span class="subtitle">
		Allegory and Symbolism</span><br><br>

		<span class="italic">‘To the fears and hopes of mortals living in constant distress, for whom it accordingly creates god and demons on whom the can call, whom they can appease’.</span> How exactly are Gods and Demons created and what is their preferred method of communication.<br><br>

		Because religion is to be made most suitable for the whole world and everyone in it the best and most accessible form of communication can be found in allegory, myth and symbolism. Allegory is found to be easy to relate to and is therefore more digestible. The message or truth of the story is easily extracted from the allegory. Religious myth, the idea of the divine creates a sublime authoritarian figure/sphere that makes the message imposing and very captivating, this effect works universally among men and therefore helps to create a more universal form of communication. Religious symbolism provides an additional means to communicate the underlying message of a religion via symbols, apart from communication by words. Symbolism clarifies a message to make its meaning more accessible to the mind and stir up emotions. It is the use of symbols, including archetypes, acts, artwork, events, or natural phenomena. Religions view religious texts, rituals, and works of art as symbols of compelling ideas or ideals. These three aspects of communication help create a resonant mythos expressing the moral values of the society or the teachings of the religion. However, there are important restrictions to the visualization or symbolization of religion. These restrictions stem from Moses second commandment. A commandment that if violated leads to idolatry, that which is understood to be sinful.<br><br>

		<span class="subtitle">The Ban of Imagery</span><br><br>

		<span class="italic">“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.”</span><br><br>

		The prohibition of images is the only commandment that receives an explanation. Thou shalt not make thyself images because God is jealous and he distinguishes between his foes, the image-worshipers, and his friends who abstain from worshiping images. Images rouse the jealousy of God because they attract worship and thus distract men from exclusively worshiping God who does not tolerate any other gods beside him. God considers images to be other gods and thus rivals. More explanation about the restriction of images can be found in the book of Deuteronomy :<span class="italic">“Therefore watch yourselves very carefully. Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making a carved image for yourselves.”</span>[2] This message claims that God is invisible. Therefore, he cannot be worshiped in anything visible. In short the reasons for forbidding imagery is: 1. Because every image represents a (false) God. This is a question of loyalty. Images are other gods and provoke God’s jealousy. 2. Because no image is able to represent the invisible God. <br><br>

		<span class="subtitle">Catholic Perspective</span><br><br>

		Let us however not forget that the prohibition took a huge turn in Christianity. It has readmitted the images, images of the visible and even images of the invisible. With its incarnation in Jesus Christ, the word became visible, conceivable for the works of art because of divines human form. There are also other visual instances where the divine had presumably created <a>acheiropoietan</a> (“made without hand”) images such as an imprint of Jesus his face on the handkerchief of Veronica. (whose name means “true image”). Christianity made a huge iconic turn over the past centuries. However the Ten Commandments remained valid and among them the prohibition of images and the incrimination of idolatry. While the reformed Christians refuse to depict Jesus or anything considered false in the eyes of the second commandment the more southern Catholic countries saw a drastic increase in icons after and during the <a>reformation</a> and the <a>renaissance</a>. Ever since the Catholic church has not been shy to depict Jesus or other divinities in various ways.<br><br>

		Their image of the icon, after all, was meant to help people in their search for God. The catholic image became realistic precisely in the name of this quest, and for the same reason its signature began to be appreciated. This paradox has been the basis of the explosive profusion of images since the Renaissance. Isn’t God, after all, a creating God? Didn’t he create the universe and assign humans a privileged place within it by making them- according to the first chapter of the Bible - <span class="italic">“in His image and likeness?”</span> Within this vision, both the image as well as all of reality, precisely in its beauty, continue to bear the sheen of the creator. Art has to emphasize the beauty of the creation, certainly wherever art represents man, who was explicitly created in God’s image. Anyone who depicts the human body in all its beauty (and since the thirteenth century. This has been seen as the highest source of beauty) is also directly paying tribute to the divine creator. <br><br>

		<span class="subtitle">Reformed Perspective</span><br><br>

		Christian history inherits a deeply rooted conflict between the production of religious imagery and the abolishment of it. One side welcomes the image as the likeness of the divine, while the other brands it as a blasphemous expression of human vanity. Most notably the Reformation of the 16th century. During the Reformation sculptures, paintings, and even organs where removed from churches and in large part destroyed. Despite Jesus having a physical form and being visible to the eye Jesus is claimed to have a second nature, the divine, the invisible. According to reformed Christian beliefs if a visual depiction of Jesus were to be made it would include Jesus Christ his second nature of the divine, that which is unimaginable and therefor refuses to acknowledge the Second Commandment. Another reformed argument would be that Jesus is part of a holy trinity that make up God as a whole. The trinity exist out of The Father, Son and Spirit and since Jesus takes part he is considered to be one with God and is therefore forbidden to illustrate by the hands of mere men.<br><br>

		The endless discussion about the prohibition of images might just throw us into an abyss of negative theology. However I am not the one to bring an end to this discussion. These idols exist and have existed for many centuries and I am merely trying to find out why there is such an inexhaustible urge in some of us to create or worship these idols.</p><br><br>


				<h3 id="IV">IV</h3>
				<h2>Power of the Idol</h2>

		<p>The idols exist and some of them have an incredible captivating power. But where does that power come from, why am I and many others so attracted to such images? Freud calls it their <span class="italic">‘Magical Claim’</span>. The image that attempts to integrate the aesthetic of the sublime can put us in a indescribable roller-coaster of sensations. Something inescapable that cannot be put into words. The sublime aesthetic is that which transcends our sensual and conceptual capabilities and exposes the horrors of the unknown. By exposing people to the unknown they find leads to answer their desire to confirm that behind the world’s physical plane there must be concealed a metaphysical one. This is their captivating power, it rips us away from our everyday life’s and show us that we might part of a much larger incomprehensible spectacle. It appeals our to inexhaustible desire to confirm that there is something bigger that drives our universe.<br><br>

		The reason why images work better more so than text is because text or speech can be answered with elaboration, counter-statements or even rejection. But how can you answer to an image? That which is indescribable and cannot be made verbal or textual. This effect has been very well put into words by Novelist Paul Auster “The world enters through our eyes, but we cannot make sense of it until it descends into our mouths”. This “magical claim” is not underestimated by the Church. The aesthetic power of the idol, if used skilfully can easily drive people in different directions, away from the original beliefs in Christian Religion. <br><br>

		However, despite the attempts of avoiding such powerful and influential images by the church, they could never stand the test of time. Since religion was to be shaped and moulded into the most accessible and captivating form of communication. The addition of the <span class="italic">‘Magical Claim’</span> imagery was inevitable. </p><br><br>

				<h3 id="V">V</h3>
				<h2>Idol Makers</h2>

		<p>The power of the idol was not to be underestimated. The great idol makers were the ones to wield this <span class="italic">‘magical claim’</span> formula in order to create their imagery. Grand pictures of amazing magnitude were created in God’s name. Be it a homage to the Divine or just an outright exposition of skill, their grip was unquestionable. <br><br>

		John Martin is a great example of an image maker who wielded the <span class="italic">‘magical claim’</span> like no other, an English Romantic painter, engraver and illustrator of the early 19th century. He was celebrated for his typically vast and melodramatic paintings of religious subjects and fantastic compositions, populated with minute figures placed in imposing landscapes. His images had the ability to instil fear onto people and create overwhelming feelings of sublimity. His most famous image “The Great Day of His Wrath”, a depiction of the words of revelation of Saint John, the end of the world. A vast landscape that is being torn apart by titanic forces, lightning strikes from the storming sky, volcanic lava spewing from the crackling earth. From John Martins customary pamphlet it said that ; <span class="italic">‘the great and leading feature of these productions is that they tend to inspire religious feeling and inculcate the desire to live morally and do good’</span>.

<div class="text">
		<p>His images travelled the world as a very peculiar exhibition for its time called a <span class="italic">‘Diorama’</span>. This method of exhibiting was meant to make the picture more realistic. The image was placed inside a confined dim space. The space was setup much like a cinema theatre. Several rows of benches were placed facing the image. The image was lit by a mechanical structure holding multiple lamps. The audience after taking seat would now witness the artificial spectacle of sublimity. The exhibition crew would operate the mechanical lamp machine in order to make the lighting more dynamic. Not just the manipulating of light was part of the show also other elements were added to the picture behind the screen as the show commenced. Flickering spotlights would expose the giant storms in the image’s sky whilst creating thundering sounds by smashing metal plates. Cries of desperation, the crushing of stone, the splattering sound of lava all added to the magnitude of the spectacle.</p>

		<abbr title="John Martin Exhibition Diorama"><img src="images/diorama.jpg"></abbr>
</div>

<div class="text">
		<p>
		During his time his artworks were not considered to be high forms of art. His techniques were considered less for it was understood only to draw in the masses, and so it did. The image became the most visited image of its time, by 1861 eight million people had seen the image, it is without exaggeration perhaps the most successful contemporary art exhibition ever. As mentioned before, his painting ‘The Great Day of his wrath’ was understood to <span class="italic">‘inspire religious feeling and inculcate the desire to live morally and do good’</span>.<br><br>

		The moral messages inherit to his paintings were of religious nature. <span class="italic">‘To live morally and do good’</span>. In conjunction with the allegories of the Bible, John Martin had the ability to inspire religious feeling like no other painting of its time. It helped sooth the metaphysical need of men. For the duration of the spectacle its visitors were drawn away from their daily life and exposed to a world beyond their own. Especially when we consider the form of its exhibition. A confined space containing a world of wonders, the image in conjunction with the added elements, an artificial portal to the metaphysical planes we so desperately seek as men. As if John Martin had become a God in his own right, especially considering the image to be an idol, creating his own parallel universe if only for a short while. And surely the people came to worship his image. </p><br><br>

				<h3 id="VI">VI</h3>
				<h2>The Engineer of Gods</h2>

		<p>A enclosed space, a portal to outer worldly exposure, artificially created to draw people in to help confirm their needs. If we look at the idea of creating artificial worlds in this manner. It is not at all unlikely that one would compare the immersive diorama exhibits of the 19th century to that of the digital exhibits of the artificial and fictional worlds of many contemporary video games. Many contemporary video games make use of the same visual rhetoric as the idols from previous ages. Despite the fictional nature of video games not sharing any unaltered Biblical background they often do inherit the same ‘magical claim’ and therefore answer the same needs of men and might inspire religious feelings nonetheless.<br><br>

		If we take another look at first sentence of the second commandment : <span class="italic">“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.”</span> It says that any depiction of likeness of what might lie beyond our own mortal world is prohibited and considered to be a false image, such is the nature of the idol, including that of video games. In the latter part of the commandment we read <span class="italic">“You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God...”</span>. When we breakdown <span class="italic">“The LORD your God am a jealous God..”</span> we can conclude that the commandment was stated in a monotheistic context, meaning that the commandment stresses that there is only one true God. However, it says that God is a jealous God, through this we can acknowledge that next to the one true God there is another or perhaps multiple Gods inspiring people to worship them. We can therefore describe the various fictional tales and depictions of worlds beyond our own as false Gods or idols, needless to say is that these more contemporary idols have accumulated massive amounts of following of their own.<br><br>

		The second commandment alarmed us for the incredible power these images can have instilled inside of them. Initially the commandment was installed partly for the possibility of religious followers straying off in different directions then of the beaten path. Nowadays there is an abundance of fictional alternatives that through their visual nature make people gravitate towards them, and most of these Godly worlds are created by the contemporary idol makers, the video game developers. </p><br><br>


				<h3>VII</h3>
				<h2>Artificial Divinity</h2>

		<p>Some of the most predominant contemporary idols (note: contemporary idols refer to the digital/artificial and fictional worlds of contemporary video games in the context of the second commandment) share many of the visual characteristics that originally stem from religious imagery or idols. Visual characteristics not only of compositions of grandeur as shown in John Martins imagery but also a wide variety of religious symbols, artefacts and religious characters. Despite the fact that the original denotation of such characteristics do not correspond with their new altered manifestations, they still resonate the same energy. As shown in the series of images from the previous section that introduces the contemporary idols we see a clear visual similarities in the comparison of the traditional religious idols and their new contemporary manifestations.<br><br>

		The first comparison is that of John Martins <span class="italic">‘The Great Day of his Wrath’</span> and one of World of Warcraft’s grand displays of landscape, WoW (World of Warcraft) is a MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role playing game) that at the hight of its popularity had a bolstering following of 12 million people. The images are similar in composition especially through the use of scale and natural forces. The images of John Martin were mainly granted their popularity and appeal through their immersive diorama exhibits. Video games share this same potential of immersion, the confined exhibition space of the 19th century has only been replaced with that of a digital monitor, the games they display draw people through their visual appeal in and make it possible for men to partake in these landscapes through means of playing. Needless to say is that people have developed a sense of artificiality through means of developing computer graphics. They diorama exhibition format is now considered obsolete when it comes to its gripping potential. The metal constructions of rotating oil lamps and the clinging of metal to recreate the sound of thunder that supported the diorama exhibit has certainly been outlived by the complicated and highly developed graphic game engines that serve as a foundation for the new idols.</p>

		The rapid development of gaming graphics is outstanding to say the least. The 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display. Over the course of 70 years the gaming industry has seen tremendous improvement in the development of computer graphics. Lifelike digital copies of Mads Mikkelsen, the Danish actor and American actor Norman Russ featured in Hideo Kojima’s most recent title Death Stranding shows a stunning display of the digital engine capabilities of today. Hideo Kojima, a profound Japanese game director and many other speculative thinkers have suggested that in future years mankind will be able to create lifelike artificial worlds of our own through mimicking the natural algorithms that make up our real world. An even more radical idea believed in by Elon Musk for instance, an entrepreneur at the frontier of technological development, suggests that we ourselves already live inside a artificial simulation and that through our own rapid development of gaming engines we will again be able to continue the cycle of lifelike artificial worlds inside one another. An endless loop of parallel universes. So much for immersion and the undying urge of mankind to seek for meaning in worlds beyond our own.<br><br>


		You can find many similarities between the old and new idols not only in their visual characteristics, that in the more contemporary instalments has been adapted to suit that particular game, but also many similarities in narrative. Allegories that carry the same morals and values. They might be told in a more simplistic black and white manner or perhaps in a more complex layered form. Of course not only religious stories carry the means to teach a valuable life lessons, however many of the contemporary idols draw inspiration from the original religious allegories. <br><br>

		Well known characters in gaming such as Prophet Velen from World of Warcraft for instance heavily resemble the likes of Jesus Christ in form and character. As his title entails, Velen is a character that has been granted the gift of prophecy, and — aided by the Light — rejected offers of dark power from Sargeras, the antagonist character similar to the likes of Judas. Velen guided his people away from sin through great sacrifices.</p>

		Sanguinius a prominent character of the Warhammer 40,000 universe shares extreme similarities with archangel Michael, who tried to keep Lucifer from betraying God before becomig a monster. In the Warhammer a similar event occurs between Sanguinius and Horus, the antagonist of the story, who resembles the likes of Lucifer. In this event Sanguinius and Horus meet face to face before Horus succumbing to madness and embracing his betrayal. Sanguinius, through the love he felt for his former comrade tries to persuade Horus from betraying the Emporor, God, despite his already sinful deeds. Horus refuses and strikes Sanguinius down. Moments before Horus’s deadly strike Sanguinius seizes the opportunity to strike Horus as well breaking his armour, Horus survives. Regardless of Horus’s survival he has now become exposed and vulnerable this turns Horus more insane and losing his sanity turning into a demon. Fictional characters that like the old testament should inspire to morally do good through their captivating legends. The list of comparable characters is nearly endless. Some more of these characters are shown in the series of image comparisons in the image section.

		<h3>VIII</h3>
		<h2>4K Rituals</h2>

		<p>As mentioned before in previous chapters religion in many functions as a means of teaching people morals and inspire them to do good in life. A wide variety of rituals and living by the rules of the Bible make up most of steps on the path to rightful living within the eyes of God. Many of these rituals add a certain structure to ones life, visiting church on Sunday morning, praying before dinner and other significant events make up the structured life proposed by a particular religion in order to fulfil ones duties and appeal to their moral conscious needs.<br><br>

		The new idols are no exception to such rituals. In order to preform well and walk the promising path of the fictional universes one must follow a strict structure of rituals. These rituals share fewer similarities in their appearance and approach but they do however deliver similar structural elements to the life of a worshipper. World of Warcraft will for instance require you to attend so called ‘raids’ on Fridays evenings or perhaps multiple nights a week from eight in the evening to sometimes late at night. Raids are rituals where large groups ranging from ten to sometimes thousands of people gather online inside the digital world. Raid groups systematically overthrow a certain obstacle in the game, most often a vile creature of great evil be it a humongous demon or a horde of lesser creatures. Such rituals require you to perform complex martial dances of incredible difficulty. Completing such rituals comes with great reward and conquer the evil bestowed in that particular world. Being unable to complete such rituals through absence or lack of skill is severely punishing, you will drastically fall behind and lose social standing among your fellow worshippers. Magic : the Gathering has similar rituals where on Friday nights groups of varying sizes physically meet in a designated area to immerse themselves in the world of Gods and Demons through rituals of gaming. Magic : The Gathering like many other games maintain a strict structure of rule that should be followed at all times, if you are unwilling to abide these rules you will be set back accordingly.

As a result many researching experts have dedicated their career to the deciphering of the stories and its morals that are being told in this alternate universe. Darks souls ‘magical claim’ and its ability to create an offspring of contemporary game theologist is one great example of contemporary idolatry and its worshippers.</p><br><br>
