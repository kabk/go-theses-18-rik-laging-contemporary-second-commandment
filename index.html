		<h1>CONTEMPORARY IDOLATRY</h1>
		<h2>Beta Abstract Version I</h2>
		<p>
			I am guilty of idolatry. I’ve violated the sacred Second Commandment. <p2>“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD you God am a jealous God...”</p2>. Yet I am not alone in this, Christian Catholics have not been shy to depict the holy trinity since the coming of Christ. Whilst the second commandment has been taken very lightly it is not fully absent, it is still respected in various ways within the field. However, some contemporary depictions of the divine have perhaps grown outside its boundaries. In this thesis I explore the limits of the Second Commandment. I am responsible for the European campaign to promote the <p2><a id="italicLink" href="http://jumpforjesus.net/" target="blank">‘Jump for Jesus, Evangelism Act’</a></p2>. This is a American initiative to spread the words of Christ in extraordinary fashion. The act combines the motorcycle jumping practice with that of a Christian missionary. The act of jumping from ramp to ramp through a burning wooden wall serves as a metaphor for the conquering of ones own sins and embracing the love of Christ. This is one of the many examples that have, in my opinion, outgrown the metaphysical boundaries of the Second Commandment. In my process of creating a promotion campaign for the <p2>‘Jump for Jesus’</p2> I try to explore the latest possibilities within the current restrictions of the second commandment. I am using their personal feedback to reflect on the current situation.<br><br><br><br><br> <a href="http://riklaging.nl" target="blank">R.L.</a>
